# mut - Music Transformer

The Music Transformer is a novel model designed for music analysis and classification, drawing inspiration from the Vision Transformer (ViT) model used in computer vision. Unlike ViT, which focuses on image analysis, the Music Transformer operates on musical compositions, processing sequences of musical notes and rhythms as input tokens.

Similar to ViT, the Music Transformer employs transformer architecture to decode complex musical structures. By representing music as a sequence of tokens, it dissects compositions into manageable segments, facilitating comprehensive analysis.

An important distinction of the Music Transformer lies in its adoption of multi-label classification. Unlike conventional methods that categorize music into discrete genres or classes, the Music Transformer embraces the multifaceted nature of musical expression. Each piece is considered as a combination of multiple labels, reflecting the diverse genres, emotions, and themes inherent in music.

Through iterative learning processes, the Music Transformer becomes adept at recognizing patterns within musical compositions. It identifies recurring motifs, analyzes the interplay between different instruments, and uncovers underlying themes within melodies.

The Music Transformer's capability for multi-label classification offers new avenues for music analysis and understanding.


The objective is that once fully trained as a mature model, it can be used as part of a larger generative musical model, producing complete compositions and driven by natural language prompts.

In summary, the Music Transformer extends transformer-based models to the domain of music analysis and classification, utilizing multi-label classification to capture the complexity and richness of musical compositions.
